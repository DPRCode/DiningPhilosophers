            <p>In this scenario, five philosophers are dining together at one table, each with their own plate and a fork between each plate. The dish being served is spaghetti, which requires two forks to eat. The philosophers can only eat and think alternately. Additionally, a philosopher can only eat if they have both a left and a right fork, meaning that two forks are only available when their nearest neighbors are thinking. After a philosopher finishes eating, they put both forks away. The challenge is to devise a scheme or concurrent algorithm that ensures no philosopher starves, allowing everyone to alternate between eating and thinking indefinitely. The catch is that the philosophers cannot know when others are about to eat or think, creating a problem of incomplete information.</p>
            <p>Each philosopher needs a fixed amount of time to inquire the scond Fork</p>
